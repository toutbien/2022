#Now youre remoted into your machine and can install your goodies if you want to
So let's take it one step further, installing xfce for SSH to give us a Desktop environment:
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get -y install xfce4

sudo apt install xfce4-session

#THen we install a remote desktop server to use with RDP on Linux (xdrp)
sudo apt-get -y install xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp

#configure the environment
echo xfce4-session >~/.xsession

#Then restart for the magic
sudo service xrdp restart

#Local account password set up:
sudo passwd azureuser
