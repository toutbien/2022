#ways to output data and then an example

#The Out-File cmdlet is most useful when you want to save output 
#as it would have displayed on the console
Get-Process | Out-Host -Paging | Format-List

#output OptionA to local text file
Get-Process | Out-File -FilePath C:\Users\toutb\mylist.txt

#output OptionB if you need ASCII encoding
Get-Process | Out-File -FilePath C:\Users\toutb\mylist.txt -Encoding ASCII

#if you want to output to your printer (it will use default unless named)
Get-Command Get-Command | Out-Printer -Name 'PrintToPDF'

#if you want to throw away any input received (for discarding unnecessary data)
#but it does not discard error output
Get-Command | Out-Null


#The working example
#pick a thing choosing from all in class Alias, Function & cmdlet 
Get-Command 

#I picked cmdlet, so the below returns all cmdlet in pwsh
Get-Command -Type cmdlet 

#What I then wanted was more details than just the clean headers, so running FormatList (alias: fl) gives
# me the Name, CommandType (already known), Definition, DLL, Path, the HelpFile (xml), the Parameters, ImplementatingType, Verb, and Noun
# I don't need all of that. Let's just select for Name, Parameters, Definition:
Get-Command -Type cmdlet | fl -Property Name,Parameters,Definition

#now let's put that in a file 
Get-Command -Type cmdlet | fl -Property Name,Parameters,Definition | Out-File somethingcool.txt

#see the file "cool.text" for the output
